This is a small web-game I made during quarantine in my spare time from classes. 

## Description

Compete against a random stranger in front of other random strangers, king of the hill style! At the end of each round, the audience votes for who won, and the loser gets kicked out. If it's a tie, then a rematch automatically begins.

The competition can be about... anything! Join any room you like, and enter the queue to go live in front of the audeince, and fight to stay up. Once you get kicked off, you can always join the queue again and get another turn. Or, if you're a bit shy, feel free to just watch along and vote for the winner in each round. Rooms have a maximum number of people that can be in a queue at once, so if the queue is full, try to fill the slot at the end of each round as fast as possible.

Some rooms will have different rules to suit their playstyle. In some rooms, players will take turns at the mic, and only one person is allowed to speak at a time. In others, both players have access to the mic at the same time.

Search through rooms and find one that interests you; or, create your own! Each room has a custom set of rules and styling to suit it's theme.
