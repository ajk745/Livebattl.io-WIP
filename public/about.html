      >Compete against a random stranger in front of other random strangers, king of the hill style!
      At the end of each round, the audience votes for who won, and the loser gets kicked out. If
      it's a tie, then a rematch automatically begins.</p

        >The competition can be about... anything! Join any room you like, and enter the queue to go
        live in front of the audeince, and fight to stay up. Once you get kicked off, you can always
        join the queue again and get another turn. Or, if you're a bit shy, feel free to just watch
        along and vote for the winner in each round. Rooms have a maximum number of people that can
        be in a queue at once, so if the queue is full, try to fill the slot at the end of each
        round as fast as possible.

        Some rooms will have different rules to suit their playstyle. In some rooms, players will
        take turns at the mic, and only one person is allowed to speak at a time. In others, both
        players have access to the mic at the same time.
